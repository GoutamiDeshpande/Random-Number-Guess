# Random-Number-Guess
The random number guessing game in Java involves generating a random number and asking the user to guess it within a certain range. If the guessed number is higher or lower than the actual number, the program provides corresponding feedback. The game ends when the user guesses the correct number or exhausts the allowed number of trials.
